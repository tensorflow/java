/**
 * Common interface for all typed tensors.
 *
 * <p>Typed tensors wrap a {@link org.tensorflow.RawTensor RawTensor} by mapping their native memory
 * to a n-dimensional data space allowing direct I/O access from the JVM.
 *
 * <p>Subinterfaces of {@code TType} are propagated as a generic parameter to various entities of
 * TensorFlow to identify the type of the tensor they carry. For example, a {@link
 * org.tensorflow.Operand Operand&lt;TFloat32&gt;} is an operand which outputs a 32-bit floating
 * point tensor. This parameter ensure type-compatibility between operands of a computation at
 * compile-time. For example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Ops tf = Ops.create();
 *
 * Constant<TFloat32> c1 = tf.array(2.0f, 3.0f, 2.0f);
 * Constant<TFloat32> c2 = tf.array(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f);
 * Constant<TInt32> c3 = tf.array(2, 3, 2);
 *
 * tf.math.add(c1, c2);  // OK
 * tf.math.add(c1, c3);  // Compilation failure
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Even if all typed tensors implements somehow {@link org.tensorflow.ndarray.NdArray NdArray} to
 * provide access to their data, {@code TType} deliberately does not extend directly from this
 * interface, for the following reasons:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implementing {@code NdArray} at this level could only expose boxed-type accessors, which
 *       are less performant than their primitive equivalent, only exposed by subinterfaces of
 *       {@code NdArray} (e.g. {@code FloatNdArray}).
 *   <li>{@code TType} would need to carry a new generic parameter for typing the {@code NdArray},
 *       which will increase the verbosity in the signature of any method accepting or returning an
 *       instance of this interface, which is very common.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Therefore, enforcing the user to cast a reference of {@code TType} in a concrete tensor type
 * before accessing its data guarantees better performance and improves readability.
