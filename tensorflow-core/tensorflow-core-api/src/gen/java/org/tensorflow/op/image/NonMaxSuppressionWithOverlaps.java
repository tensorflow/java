/**
 * Greedily selects a subset of bounding boxes in descending order of score,
 * pruning away boxes that have high overlaps
 * with previously selected boxes.  Bounding boxes with score less than
 * {@code score_threshold} are removed. N-by-n overlap values are supplied as square matrix,
 * which allows for defining a custom overlap criterium (eg. intersection over union,
 * intersection over area, etc.).
 * <p>The output of this operation is a set of integers indexing into the input
 * collection of bounding boxes representing the selected boxes.  The bounding
 * box coordinates corresponding to the selected indices can then be obtained
 * using the {@code tf.gather operation}.  For example:
 * <p>selected_indices = tf.image.non_max_suppression_with_overlaps(
 * overlaps, scores, max_output_size, overlap_threshold, score_threshold)
 * selected_boxes = tf.gather(boxes, selected_indices)
