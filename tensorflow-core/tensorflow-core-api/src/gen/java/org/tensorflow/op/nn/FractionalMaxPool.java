/**
 * Performs fractional max pooling on the input.
 * <p>
 * Fractional max pooling is slightly different than regular max pooling.  In
 * regular max pooling, you downsize an input set by taking the maximum value of
 * smaller N x N subsections of the set (often 2x2), and try to reduce the set by
 * a factor of N, where N is an integer.  Fractional max pooling, as you might
 * expect from the word "fractional", means that the overall reduction ratio N
 * does not have to be an integer.
 * <p>
 * The sizes of the pooling regions are generated randomly but are fairly uniform.
 * For example, let's look at the height dimension, and the constraints on the
 * list of rows that will be pool boundaries.
 * <p>
 * First we define the following:
 * <p>
 * 1.  input_row_length : the number of rows from the input set
 * 2.  output_row_length : which will be smaller than the input
 * 3.  alpha = input_row_length / output_row_length : our reduction ratio
 * 4.  K = floor(alpha)
 * 5.  row_pooling_sequence : this is the result list of pool boundary rows
 * <p>
 * Then, row_pooling_sequence should satisfy:
 * <p>
 * 1.  a[0] = 0 : the first value of the sequence is 0
 * 2.  a[end] = input_row_length : the last value of the sequence is the size
 * 3.  K <= (a[i+1] - a[i]) <= K+1 : all intervals are K or K+1 size
 * 4.  length(row_pooling_sequence) = output_row_length+1
 * <p>
 * For more details on fractional max pooling, see this paper:
 * [Benjamin Graham, Fractional Max-Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6071)

 * @param <T> data type for {@code output()} output
