  summary: "Computes the eigen decomposition of one or more square matrices."
  description: <<END
Computes the eigenvalues and (optionally) right eigenvectors of each inner matrix in
`input` such that `input[..., :, :] = v[..., :, :] * diag(e[..., :])`. The eigenvalues
are sorted in non-decreasing order.

```python
# a is a tensor.
# e is a tensor of eigenvalues.
# v is a tensor of eigenvectors.
e, v = eig(a)
e = eig(a, compute_v=False)
```
