  summary: "Computes the Kth order statistic of a data set. The current"
  description: <<END
implementation uses a binary search requiring exactly 32 passes over
the input data. The running time is linear with respect to input
size. The median-of-medians algorithm is probably faster, but is
difficult to implement efficiently in XLA. The implementation imposes
a total ordering on floats. The ordering is consistent with the usual
partial order.  Positive NaNs are greater than positive
infinity. Negative NaNs are less than negative infinity. NaNs with
distinct payloads are treated as distinct. Subnormal numbers are
preserved (not flushed to zero). Positive infinity is greater than all
numbers. Negative infinity is less than all numbers. Positive is
greater than negative zero. There are less than k values greater than
the kth order statistic. There are at least k values greater than or
equal to the Kth order statistic. The semantics are not the same as
top_k_unique.
