/**
 * Reshapes a tensor.
 * Given {@code tensor}, this operation returns a tensor that has the same values
 * as {@code tensor} with shape {@code shape}.
 * <p>If one component of 1-D tensor {@code shape} is the special value -1, the size of that
 * dimension is computed so that the total size remains constant.  In particular, a
 * {@code shape} of {@code [-1]} flattens into 1-D.  At most one component of {@code shape} may be
 * unknown.
 * <p>The {@code shape} must be 1-D and the operation returns a tensor with shape
 * {@code shape} filled with the values of {@code tensor}. In this case, the number of elements
 * implied by {@code shape} must be the same as the number of elements in {@code tensor}.
 * <p>It is an error if {@code shape} is not 1-D.
 * <p>For example:
 * <pre>
 * # tensor 't' is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
 * # tensor 't' has shape [9]
 * reshape(t, [3, 3]) ==&gt; [[1, 2, 3],
 *                         [4, 5, 6],
 *                         [7, 8, 9]]
 *
 * # tensor 't' is [[[1, 1], [2, 2]],
 * #                [[3, 3], [4, 4]]]
 * # tensor 't' has shape [2, 2, 2]
 * reshape(t, [2, 4]) ==&gt; [[1, 1, 2, 2],
 *                         [3, 3, 4, 4]]
 *
 * # tensor 't' is [[[1, 1, 1],
 * #                 [2, 2, 2]],
 * #                [[3, 3, 3],
 * #                 [4, 4, 4]],
 * #                [[5, 5, 5],
 * #                 [6, 6, 6]]]
 * # tensor 't' has shape [3, 2, 3]
 * # pass '[-1]' to flatten 't'
 * reshape(t, [-1]) ==&gt; [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6]
 *
 * # -1 can also be used to infer the shape
 *
 * # -1 is inferred to be 9:
 * reshape(t, [2, -1]) ==&gt; [[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3],
 *                          [4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6]]

 *                          [4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6]]
 * # -1 is inferred to be 3:
 * reshape(t, [ 2, -1, 3]) ==&gt; [[[1, 1, 1],
 *                               [2, 2, 2],
