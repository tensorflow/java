    description: <<END
Tensor debug mode: the mode in which the input tensor is summarized
  by the op. See the TensorDebugMode enum in
  tensorflow/core/protobuf/debug_event.proto for details.

Supported values:
  2 (CURT_HEALTH): Output a float32/64 tensor of shape [2]. The 1st
  element is the tensor_id, if provided, and -1 otherwise. The 2nd
  element is a bit which is set to 1 if the input tensor has an
  infinity or nan value, or zero otherwise.

  3 (CONCISE_HEALTH): Output a float32/64 tensor of shape [5]. The 1st
  element is the tensor_id, if provided, and -1 otherwise. The
  remaining four slots are the total number of elements, -infs,
  +infs, and nans in the input tensor respectively.

  4 (FULL_HEALTH): Output a float32/64 tensor of shape [11]. The 1st
  element is the tensor_id, if provided, and -1 otherwise. The 2nd
  element is the device_id, if provided, and -1 otherwise. The 3rd
  element holds the datatype value of the input tensor as according
  to the enumerated type in tensorflow/core/framework/types.proto.
  The remaining elements hold the total number of elements, -infs,
  +infs, nans, negative finite numbers, zeros, and positive finite
  numbers in the input tensor respectively.

  5 (SHAPE): Output a float32/64 tensor of shape [10]. The 1st
  element is the tensor_id, if provided, and -1 otherwise. The 2nd
  element holds the datatype value of the input tensor as according
  to the enumerated type in tensorflow/core/framework/types.proto.
  The 3rd element holds the rank of the tensor. The 4th element holds
  the number of elements within the tensor. Finally the remaining 6
  elements hold the shape of the tensor. If the rank of the tensor
  is lower than 6, the shape is right padded with zeros. If the rank
  is greater than 6, the head of the shape is truncated.

  6 (FULL_NUMERICS): Output a float32/64 tensor of shape [22]. The 1st
  element is the tensor_id, if provided, and -1 otherwise. The 2nd
  element is the device_id, if provided, and -1 otherwise. The 3rd
  element holds the datatype value of the input tensor as according
  to the enumerated type in tensorflow/core/framework/types.proto.
  The 4th element holds the rank of the tensor. The 5th to 11th
  elements hold the shape of the tensor. If the rank of the tensor
  is lower than 6, the shape is right padded with zeros. If the rank
  is greater than 6, the head of the shape is truncated. The 12th to
  18th elements hold the number of elements, -infs, +infs, nans,
  denormal floats, negative finite numbers, zeros, and positive
  finite numbers in the input tensor respectively. The final four
  elements hold the min value, max value, mean, and variance of the
  input tensor.

  8 (REDUCE_INF_NAN_THREE_SLOTS): Output a float32/64 tensor of shape
  [3]. The 1st element is -inf if any elements of the input tensor
  is -inf, or zero otherwise. The 2nd element is +inf if any elements
  of the input tensor is +inf, or zero otherwise.  The 3rd element is
  nan if any element of the input tensor is nan, or zero otherwise.

  summary: "Debug Numeric Summary V2 Op."
  description: <<END
Computes a numeric summary of the input tensor. The shape of the output
depends on the tensor_debug_mode attribute.
