/**
 * A metric that computes the mean of absolute difference between labels and predictions.
 *
 * <p>The {@code MeanSquaredError} class creates two local variables, {@code total} and {@code
 * count} that are used to compute the mean squared error. This average is weighted by {@code
 * weights}, and it is ultimately returned as the mean squared error: an idempotent operation that
 * simply divides {@code total} by {@code count}.
 *
 * <p>For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an update operation
 * that updates these variables. Internally, a squared error operation computes the element-wise
 * square of the difference between {@code predictions} and {@code labels}. Then the update
 * operation increments {@code total} with the reduced sum of the product of {@code weights} and the
 * squared error, and it increments {@code count} with the reduced sum of {@code weights}.
 *
 * <p>If {@code weights} is null, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.
 *
 * @param <T> The data type for the metric result.
