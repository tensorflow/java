/**
 * Computes the Kth order statistic of a data set. The current
 * implementation uses a binary search requiring exactly 32 passes over
 * the input data. The running time is linear with respect to input
 * size. The median-of-medians algorithm is probably faster, but is
 * difficult to implement efficiently in XLA. The implementation imposes
 * a total ordering on floats. The ordering is consistent with the usual
 * partial order.  Positive NaNs are greater than positive
 * infinity. Negative NaNs are less than negative infinity. NaNs with
 * distinct payloads are treated as distinct. Subnormal numbers are
 * preserved (not flushed to zero). Positive infinity is greater than all
 * numbers. Negative infinity is less than all numbers. Positive is
 * greater than negative zero. There are less than k values greater than
 * the kth order statistic. There are at least k values greater than or
 * equal to the Kth order statistic. The semantics are not the same as
 * top_k_unique.
