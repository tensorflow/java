  summary: "Returns the TopK values in the array in sorted order."
  description: <<END
This is a combination of MakeUnique and TopKUnique. The returned top-K will
have its lower bits replaced by iota, thus it will be close to the original
value but not exactly the same. The running time is proportional to the product
of K and the input size. NaNs are never returned. Subnormal numbers are flushed
to zero.
