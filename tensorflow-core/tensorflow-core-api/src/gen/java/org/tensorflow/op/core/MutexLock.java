/**
 * Locks a mutex resource.  The output is the lock.  So long as the lock tensor
 * is alive, any other request to use {@code MutexLock} with this mutex will wait.
 * <p>This is particularly useful for creating a critical section when used in
 * conjunction with {@code MutexLockIdentity}:
 * <pre>
 *
 * mutex = mutex_v2(
 *   shared_name=handle_name, container=container, name=name)
 *
 * def execute_in_critical_section(fn, *args, **kwargs):
 *   lock = gen_resource_variable_ops.mutex_lock(mutex)
 *
 *   with ops.control_dependencies([lock]):
 *     r = fn(*args, **kwargs)
 *
 *   with ops.control_dependencies(nest.flatten(r)):
 *     with ops.colocate_with(mutex):
 *       ensure_lock_exists = mutex_lock_identity(lock)
 *
 *     # Make sure that if any element of r is accessed, all of
 *     # them are executed together.
 *     r = nest.map_structure(tf.identity, r)
 *
 *   with ops.control_dependencies([ensure_lock_exists]):
 *     return nest.map_structure(tf.identity, r)
 * </pre>
 * <p>While {@code fn} is running in the critical section, no other functions which wish to
 * use this critical section may run.
 * <p>Often the use case is that two executions of the same graph, in parallel,
 * wish to run {@code fn}; and we wish to ensure that only one of them executes
 * at a time.  This is especially important if {@code fn} modifies one or more
 * variables at a time.
 * <p>It is also useful if two separate functions must share a resource, but we
 * wish to ensure the usage is exclusive.
