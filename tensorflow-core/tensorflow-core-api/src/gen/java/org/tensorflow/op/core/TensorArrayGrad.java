/**
 * Creates a TensorArray for storing the gradients of values in the given handle.
 * If the given TensorArray gradient already exists, returns a reference to it.
 * <p>Locks the size of the original TensorArray by disabling its dynamic size flag.
 * <p><strong>A note about the input flow_in:</strong>
 * <p>The handle flow_in forces the execution of the gradient lookup to occur
 * only after certain other operations have occurred.  For example, when
 * the forward TensorArray is dynamically sized, writes to this TensorArray
 * may resize the object.  The gradient TensorArray is statically sized based
 * on the size of the forward TensorArray when this operation executes.
 * Furthermore, the size of the forward TensorArray is frozen by this call.
 * As a result, the flow is used to ensure that the call to generate the gradient
 * TensorArray only happens after all writes are executed.
 * <p>In the case of dynamically sized TensorArrays, gradient computation should
 * only be performed on read operations that have themselves been chained via
 * flow to occur only after all writes have executed. That way the final size
 * of the forward TensorArray is known when this operation is called.
 * <p><strong>A note about the source attribute:</strong>
 * <p>TensorArray gradient calls use an accumulator TensorArray object.  If
 * multiple gradients are calculated and run in the same session, the multiple
 * gradient nodes may accidentally flow through the same accumulator TensorArray.
 * This double counts and generally breaks the TensorArray gradient flow.
 * <p>The solution is to identify which gradient call this particular
 * TensorArray gradient is being called in.  This is performed by identifying
 * a unique string (e.g. &quot;gradients&quot;, &quot;gradients_1&quot;, ...) from the input
 * gradient Tensor's name.  This string is used as a suffix when creating
 * the TensorArray gradient object here (the attribute {@code source}).
 * <p>The attribute {@code source} is added as a suffix to the forward TensorArray's
 * name when performing the creation / lookup, so that each separate gradient
 * calculation gets its own TensorArray accumulator.
