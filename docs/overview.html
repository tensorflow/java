TensorFlow-Java provides a Java API for TensorFlow, wrapped around TensorFlow's C API.
It allows the training and deployment of models using TensorFlow, with a focus on serving models trained using
other TensorFlow APIs.
<p>
It is split into 4 modules:
<ul>
    <li>tensorflow - The core TF-Java module which provides functionality for loading, saving and deploying TensorFlow models, along with Java definitions of all TensorFlow operators.</li>
    <li>tensorflow.framework - Higher level framework functionality for optimizers, losses, metrics etc.</li>
    <li>tensorflow.generator - Java side op generation code from TensorFlow's op definition protobufs.</li>
    <li>tensorflow.native - The low level Java - C API binding.</li>
</ul>
<p>
TensorFlow-Java is developed in the open on <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/java">GitHub</a> by members of the TensorFlow community.
