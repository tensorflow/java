  summary: "Round-robin load balancing on TPU cores."
  description: <<END
A load balancing op that round-robins among TPU cores.

This op round-robins between the integers in [0, NumTPUCoresVisiblePerHost]. It
is useful for interfacing with TensorFlow ops that take as input a TPU core on
which to execute computations, such as `TPUPartitionedCall`.

device_ordinal: An integer in [0, NumTPUCoresVisiblePerHost].
