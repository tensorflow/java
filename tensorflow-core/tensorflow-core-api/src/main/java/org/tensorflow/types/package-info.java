/**
 * Defines classes that represent TensorFlow tensor types. For each possible data type that can be
 * used in a tensor, there is a corresponding interface that is used to represent it and its hidden
 * implementation. For example, the TensorFlow int32 type is represented by the tensor type interface
 * {@link org.tensorflow.types.TInt32 TInt32}, where the {@code T} prefix stands for "Tensor of".
 *
 * <p>To support compile-time checking of tensor element types, each interface in this package must be
 * bound to one of the marker interface found in {@link org.tensorflow.types.family}, according
 * to the nature of the data.
 *
 * <p>Each tensor type must provide a static instance of {@link org.tensorflow.DataType}
 * carrying type metadata that should be used for allocating a tensor of this type or to pass
 * this type as an operation argument. For example, metadata about TensorFlow int32 type is
 * found in {@link org.tensorflow.types.TInt32#DTYPE TInt32.DTYPE}.
 *
 * <p>Instances of tensor types must also implement the {@link org.tensorflow.ndarray.NdArray NdArray}
 * interface so a user can access directly the tensor data in a n-dimensional space by invoking
 * {@link org.tensorflow.Tensor#data() Tensor.data()}.
 *
 * <p>Note that while it is always possible to allocate a tensor using the
 * {@link org.tensorflow.Tensor#of(org.tensorflow.DataType, Shape) Tensor.of(...)}
 * method, most tensor types expose factory methods that simplify the creation process, like
 * {@code scalarOf(...)}, {@code vectorOf(...)}, {@code tensorOf(...)}, etc.
