/**
 * Tensor contraction according to Einstein summation convention.
 * Implements generalized Tensor contraction and reduction. Each input Tensor must
 * have a corresponding input subscript appearing in the comma-separated left-hand
 * side of the equation. The right-hand side of the equation consists of the
 * output subscript. The input subscripts and the output subscript should consist
 * of zero or more named axis labels and at most one ellipsis ({@code ...}).
 * <p>The named axis labels may be any single character other than those having
 * special meaning, namely {@code ,.->}. The behavior of this Op is undefined if it
 * receives an ill-formatted equation; since the validation is done at
 * graph-building time, we omit format validation checks at runtime.
 * <p>Note: This Op is <em>not</em> intended to be called by the user; instead users should
 * call {@code tf.einsum} directly. It is a hidden Op used by {@code tf.einsum}.
 * <p>Operations are applied to the input(s) according to the following rules:
 * <p>(a) Generalized Diagonals: For input dimensions corresponding to axis labels
 * appearing more than once in the same input subscript, we take the
 * generalized ({@code k}-dimensional) diagonal.
 * For example, in the equation {@code iii->i} with input shape {@code [3, 3, 3]}, the
 * generalized diagonal would consist of {@code 3} elements at indices {@code (0, 0, 0)},
 * {@code (1, 1, 1)} and {@code (2, 2, 2)} to create a Tensor of shape {@code [3]}.
 * <p>(b) Reduction: Axes corresponding to labels appearing only in one input
 * subscript but not in the output subscript are summed over prior to Tensor
 * contraction.
 * For example, in the equation {@code ab,bc->b}, the axis labels {@code a} and {@code c} are
 * the reduction axis labels.
 * <p>(c) Batch Dimensions: Axes corresponding to labels appearing in each of the
 * input subscripts and also in the output subscript make up the batch
 * dimensions in Tensor contraction. Unnamed axis labels corresponding to
 * ellipsis ({@code ...}) also correspond to batch dimensions.
 * For example, for the equation denoting batch matrix multiplication,
 * {@code bij,bjk->bik}, the axis label {@code b} corresponds to a batch dimension.
 * <p>(d) Contraction: In case of binary einsum, axes corresponding to labels
 * appearing in two different inputs (and not in the output) are contracted
 * against each other.
 * Considering the batch matrix multiplication equation again
 * ({@code bij,bjk->bik}), the contracted axis label is {@code j}.
 * <p>(e) Expand Diagonal: If the output subscripts contain repeated (explicit) axis
 * labels, the opposite operation of (a) is applied. For example, in the
 * equation {@code i->iii}, and input shape {@code [3]}, the output of shape {@code [3, 3, 3]}
 * are all zeros, except for the (generalized) diagonal which is populated
 * with values from the input.
 * Note: This operation is not supported by {@code np.einsum} or {@code tf.einsum}; it is
 * provided to enable computing the symbolic gradient of {@code tf.einsum}.
 * <p>The output subscripts must contain only labels appearing in at least one of the
 * input subscripts. Furthermore, all dimensions mapping to the same axis label
 * must be equal.
 * <p>Any of the input and output subscripts may contain at most a single ellipsis
 * ({@code ...}). These ellipsis are mapped against dimensions not corresponding to any
 * named axis label. If two inputs contain ellipsis, then they are broadcasted
 * according to standard NumPy broadcasting
 *  <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html">rules</a> .
 * <p>The broadcasted dimensions are placed in the corresponding location of the
 * ellipsis in the output subscript. If the broadcasted dimensions are non-empty
 * and the output subscripts do not contain ellipsis, then an InvalidArgument error
 * is raised.
 * <p>{@literal @}compatibility(numpy)<br>
 * Similar to  <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html">{@code numpy.einsum}</a> .
 * <p>Comparison with {@code numpy.einsum}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>This Op only supports unary and binary forms of {@code numpy.einsum}.</li>
 * <li>This Op does not support implicit form. (i.e. equations without {@code ->}).</li>
 * <li>This Op also supports repeated indices in the output subscript, which is not
 * supported by {@code numpy.einsum}.
 * <br>{@literal @}end_compatibility</li>
 * </ul>
