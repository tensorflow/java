  summary: "Outputs deterministic pseudorandom random values from a uniform distribution."
  description: <<END
The generated values follow a uniform distribution in the range `[0, 1)`. The
lower bound 0 is included in the range, while the upper bound 1 is excluded.

The outputs are a deterministic function of `shape`, `key`, `counter` and `alg`.
