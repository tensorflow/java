Now, all Java-related code has been moved to this repository so that it can evolve and  be released independently from official TensorFlow releases. In addition, most of the build tasks have been migrated from Bazel to Maven, which is more familiar for most Java developers.</p> <p>The following describes the layout of the repository and its different artifacts:</p>"},{"location":"#tensorflow-core","title":"tensorflow-core","text":"<ul> <li>Intended audience: developers who wants to deploy a TensorFlow model on a JVM for inference.
