  summary: "Returns element-wise remainder of division."
  description: <<END
This follows Python semantics in that the
result here is consistent with a flooring divide. E.g.
`floor(x / y) * y + floormod(x, y) = x`, regardless of the signs of x and y.

*NOTE*: `FloorMod` supports broadcasting. More about broadcasting
