Whether this op will be gated. If any of the debug_urls of this

  summary: "Debug Numeric Summary Op."
  description: <<END
Provide a basic summary of numeric value types, range and distribution.

output: A double tensor of shape [14 + nDimensions], where nDimensions is the
  number of dimensions of the tensor's shape. The elements of output are:
  [0]: is initialized (1.0) or not (0.0).
  [1]: total number of elements
  [2]: NaN element count
  [3]: generalized -inf count: elements <= lower_bound. lower_bound is -inf by
    default.
  [4]: negative element count (excluding -inf), if lower_bound is the default
    -inf. Otherwise, this is the count of elements > lower_bound and < 0.
  [5]: zero element count
  [6]: positive element count (excluding +inf), if upper_bound is the default
    +inf. Otherwise, this is the count of elements < upper_bound and > 0.
  [7]: generalized +inf count, elements >= upper_bound. upper_bound is +inf by
    default.
Output elements [1:8] are all zero, if the tensor is uninitialized.
  [8]: minimum of all non-inf and non-NaN elements.
       If uninitialized or no such element exists: +inf.
  [9]: maximum of all non-inf and non-NaN elements.
       If uninitialized or no such element exists: -inf.
  [10]: mean of all non-inf and non-NaN elements.
        If uninitialized or no such element exists: NaN.
  [11]: variance of all non-inf and non-NaN elements.
        If uninitialized or no such element exists: NaN.
  [12]: Data type of the tensor encoded as an enum integer. See the DataType
        proto for more details.
  [13]: Number of dimensions of the tensor (ndims).
  [14+]: Sizes of the dimensions.
