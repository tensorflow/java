# Kotlin API

This is the home of the Kotlin API for TensorFlow Java. The API lives in `tensorflow-core-api`, and uses the annotation processor in `tensorflow-core-generator`.

There is no framework wrapper yet, as most of the framework classes work fine from Kotlin, but if there is a need one could be addded.

For contributing guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#kotlin-api).
