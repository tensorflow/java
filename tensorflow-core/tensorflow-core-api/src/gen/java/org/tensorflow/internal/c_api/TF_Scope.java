/** \addtogroup core
 *  \{
 <p>
 *  A {@code Scope} object represents a set of related TensorFlow ops that have the
 *  same properties such as a common name prefix.
 * 
 *  A Scope object is a container for TensorFlow Op properties. Op constructors
 *  get a Scope object as a mandatory first argument and the constructed op
 *  acquires the properties in the object.
 * 
 *  A simple example:
 * 
 *      using namespace ops;
 *      Scope root = Scope::NewRootScope();
 *      auto c1 = Const(root, { {1, 1} });
 *      auto m = MatMul(root, c1, { {41}, {1} });
 *      GraphDef gdef;
 *      Status s = root.ToGraphDef(&gdef);
 *      if (!s.ok()) { ... }
 * 
 *  Scope hierarchy:
 * 
 *  The Scope class provides various With<> functions that create a new scope.
 *  The new scope typically has one property changed while other properties are
 *  inherited from the parent scope.
 *  NewSubScope(name) method appends {@code name} to the prefix of names for ops
 *  created within the scope, and WithOpName() changes the suffix which
 *  otherwise defaults to the type of the op.
 * 
 *  Name examples:
 * 
 *      Scope root = Scope::NewRootScope();
 *      Scope linear = root.NewSubScope("linear");
 *      // W will be named "linear/W"
 *      auto W = Variable(linear.WithOpName("W"),
 *                        {2, 2}, DT_FLOAT);
 *      // b will be named "linear/b_3"
 *      int idx = 3;
 *      auto b = Variable(linear.WithOpName("b_", idx),
 *                        {2}, DT_FLOAT);
 *      auto x = Const(linear, {...});  // name: "linear/Const"
 *      auto m = MatMul(linear, x, W);  // name: "linear/MatMul"
 *      auto r = BiasAdd(linear, m, b); // name: "linear/BiasAdd"
 * 
 *  Scope lifetime:
 * 
 *  A new scope is created by calling Scope::NewRootScope. This creates some
 *  resources that are shared by all the child scopes that inherit from this
 *  scope, directly or transitively. For instance, a new scope creates a new
 *  Graph object to which operations are added when the new scope or its
 *  children are used by an Op constructor. The new scope also has a Status
 *  object which will be used to indicate errors by Op-constructor functions
 *  called on any child scope. The Op-constructor functions have to check the
 *  scope's status by calling the ok() method before proceeding to construct the
 *  op.
 * 
 *  Thread safety:
 * 
 *  A {@code Scope} object is NOT thread-safe. Threads cannot concurrently call
 *  op-constructor functions on the same {@code Scope} object. */
