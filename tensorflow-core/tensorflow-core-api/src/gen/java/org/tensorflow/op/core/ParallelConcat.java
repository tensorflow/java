/**
 * Concatenates a list of {@code N} tensors along the first dimension.
 * The input tensors are all required to have size 1 in the first dimension.
 * <p>For example:
 * <pre>
 * # 'x' is [[1, 4]]
 * # 'y' is [[2, 5]]
 * # 'z' is [[3, 6]]
 * parallel_concat([x, y, z]) =&gt; [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]  # Pack along first dim.
 * </pre>
 * <p>The difference between concat and parallel_concat is that concat requires all
 * of the inputs be computed before the operation will begin but doesn't require
 * that the input shapes be known during graph construction.  Parallel concat
 * will copy pieces of the input into the output as they become available, in
 * some situations this can provide a performance benefit.
 *
 * @param <T> data type for {@code output} output
